  <h2>üèÖ Anyone can participate! <a href="#top" class="top">Top üîº</a></h2>
  <p>Regardless of skill level and prior experience with the demoscene, participating with a production entry is a
    tradition
    at demoparties and we strongly encourage everyone to submit an entry. You're still welcome to attend even if
    you don't
    but it's more fun if you bring something.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>üí° Competitions vs Showcases<a href="#top" class="top">Top üîº</a></h2>
  <p>Demoparties typically have <a href="https://2023.inercia.pt/index.php?page=Participation#realtime">competitions</a> in many categories
    that are voted by the public to find a winner,
    this year at
    In√©rcia we are only having 4 competitions, all of them focused around realtime executable entries. For other
    traditional
    demoscene categories such as graphics, audio and wild (and realtime executable entries that do not want to
    be voted
    upon) we will have <a href="https://2023.inercia.pt/index.php?page=Participation#graphics">showcases</a>
    which will not be voted / ranked, instead we will have a panel of expert
    demosceners talk
    about each entry submitted imediately after the showcase to contextualize it for the viewers.</p>
  <p>This is an experiment, we hope it encourages more people to participate regardless of skill level. It allows
    people to
    focus on a single high quality production instead of many competition fillers. If you're a newcomer, on the
    showcases
    you will get relevant and encouraging feedback on how you can improve your craft. If you're a seasoned
    demoscener and
    dislike the voting side of competitions, on the showcases your entry will get properly contextualized by a
    panel of
    demoscene experts, explaining its merits and demoscene culture significance to the viewers.</p>
  <p>We are also organizing a few <a href="https://2023.inercia.pt/index.php?page=Participation#livecoding">live
      coding</a> sessions where you can participate (locally or remotely).

  <h2>‚ú® Realtime Competitions<a href="#top" class="top">Top üîº</a></h2>
  <p>We will have 4 competitions at In√©rcia this year. All of them for realtime executable entries:</p>
  <ul class="styled">
    <li><strong>Demo</strong> (no size limit, open to all modern and retro platforms)</li>
    <li><strong>Intro</strong> (1kb ~ 64kb in a single executable file size, open to all modern and retro
      platforms)</li>
    <li><strong>Tiny Intro</strong> (for tiny size intros of any size category up to 512b, open to all
      platforms)</li>

      entries on fantasy console
      platforms with cart size of maximum 512 bytes)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please submit a zip with your entry: it should contain the entry itself and a short text file explaining the
    platform,
    tools, techniques and references used. This text file should also explain the best way to replay the entry,
    especially
    if it targets a non Windows PC platform and needs specific settings. if it's targetting a platform that we
    might
    potentially play incorrectly or using an emulator against your wishes please also include a video capture of
    it, 1080p60
    prefered for modern platforms, or whatever is the best quality capture for your target platform (50hz also
    fine).</p>
  <p>The competition results will be determined by public voting. Anyone who logs in to our party system can vote
    on the
    entries (at party location or remote)</p>
