  <h2>üßä Demoscene</h2>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">Demoscene</a> is an international computer art
    subculture
    focused on producing so-called demos: self-contained,
    sometimes extremely small, computer programs that display audiovisual content. The purpose of a demo is to
    show
    off
    programming, visual art, and musical skills.</p>
