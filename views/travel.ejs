  <h2>🚉 By public transport</h2>
  <p>Upon arriving in Lisbon, by plane, train or bus, you could either take the metro or train to Sete Rios, then
    the train
    to Pragal and lastly the tram/surface metro to São João Baptista, and then walk for 5 minutes.</p>
  <p>Another option would be to take the Lisbon metro to Cais do Sodré, then take the beautiful boat trip to
    Cacilhas, and
    then walk for 15 minutes.</p>
  <p>Both journeys will take about 1 hour and be sure to buy a <a href="https://www.metrolisboa.pt/en/buy/viva-viagem-card/">Viva Viagem green card</a>
    (€0.50) and top it up with
    the
    "zapping" option (minimum €5).</p>
